# Codenames by Vlaada ChvÃ¡til

Webapp implementation of the classic boardgame, Codenames. The board can be viewed either as a spymaster or an agent. Two teams can compete by each having a Spymaster give one word clues which can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team.
